Some of the articles of my blog use code snippets to demonstrate the concepts I discuss. The snippets are based on the example projects you can find in this repository. To access the examples, check out the name of the example project mentioned in the article you are reading and run the commands below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anatoliykmetyuk/anatoliykmetyuk.github.io.git akmetiuk
cd akmetiuk
git checkout thera
cd src/code/<example_name>
```

The above commands will give you a command line opened in the folder with a given example project. You can run them with `sbt run`, and you can browse the sources by opening that folder in your IDE or a text editor.
