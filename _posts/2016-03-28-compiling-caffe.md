title: Compiling Caffe, the Deep Neural Network

Google released its [Deep Dream](https://github.com/google/deepdream) source code recently. In order to get it running, you need to install the [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) deep neural network. This turned out to be not that trivial task, since Caffe is still under development. So I decided to write this post about how I did it. Hopefully someone will find it helpful.
